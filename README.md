## EnergeticV
EnergeticV is a utility executor script for Roblox that preloads all assets in the game, making the game load faster for users with slow internet connections.

### How to use
1. Copy the script and paste it into your autoexecute.
2. Play any game.

### How it works
EnergeticV waits until the game is fully loaded and then starts preloading assets. It first preloads all the descendants of the player's GUI, followed by all the descendants of each service in the game. Finally, it preloads all the descendants of the game itself.
